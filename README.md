# dragonmanbot
A twitch/discord bot I am writing for my channel. 

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dragonmantank/dragonmanbot.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dragonmantank/dragonmanbot)

This is a bot I've been writing live over at [https://www.twitch.tv/dragonmantank/](https://www.twitch.tv/dragonmantank/), and is used to run my Twitch channel and eventually my Discord channel. I'm not promising this thing is better than other Twitch/Discord bots, but it's mine. Feel free make suggestions on functionality or things I can do better.
